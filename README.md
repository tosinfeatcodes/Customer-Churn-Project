# Customer-Churn-Project
Customer Churn analysis for an electricity provider


Objective: 
Develop a predictive model based to forecast customer churn for an electricity power 
company, focusing on the SME customer segment. 

Background: 
The company has experienced a significant churn rate in the SME segment, 
impacting revenue. Research indicates that price sensitivity is a major factor driving churn. The 
project’s goal is to predict customers likely to churn and devise strategies to reduce this rate. 
Data Provided: 
• Customer Data: Includes client characteristics such as industry, historical electricity 
consumption, and date joined. 
• Churn Data: Indicates whether a customer has churned. 
• Historical Price Data: Shows the prices charged to each customer for electricity and gas 
at various intervals. 

Tasks: 
1. Data Exploration: Analyse the datasets to understand the factors contributing to 
customer churn. 
2. Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features that could improve the 
model’s predictive power. 
3. Model Development: Use the appropriate algorithm(s) to develop the churn prediction 
model. 
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance using appropriate metrics. 
5. Strategy Formulation: Based on the model’s insights, propose targeted strategies to 
reduce churn, focusing on high-value customers with a high probability of churning.

Deliverables: 
• A Jupyter Notebook containing the exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model 
development, and evaluation. 
• A Power BI dashboard showing relevant visualization. 
• A PowerPoint report summarizing the findings, model performance, and proposed 
strategies for churn reduction. 

Evaluation Criteria: 
• Accuracy and robustness of the predictive model. 
• Creativity and effectiveness of the proposed churn reduction strategies. 
• Clarity and thoroughness of the analysis and report.
